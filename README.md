Integrate meta mask in a simple web app using web3.js.

I have created a simple web app in which I have used a connect button to connect to metamask.
When we use the connect button it first checks whether the user as installed metamask or not
if yes then it straight away connect with the metamask
else it will show "MetaMask is not installed!" in the console
I have used HTMl and javascript for the code
Used Web3.js library
Once the Web3.js library is loaded, it can be used to interact with Ethereum nodes using JavaScript
To use the Web3.js library in a web page, the src attribute of a <script> is used
